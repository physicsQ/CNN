## To do

### Leon

1. ~~Modify forward fully-connected layer and move it under CNN object class~~
2. ~~Backpropagation for fully-connnected layer~~
3. ~~Backpropagation for max-pooling layer~~
4. ~~Backpropagation for convolution layer~~
5. ~~Stochastic gradient descent for weight updates~~

### Things to parallelize
1. The loops in conv_layer

#### Optional
2. The loop through samples in the minibatch in SGD
